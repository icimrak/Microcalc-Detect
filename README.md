# Microcalc-Detect
Convolutional network model trained for detection of microcalcifications using patch classification approach

The files must be concatenated by e.g. the macos/linux command

cat model.* > PRETRAINED_RESNET101_ADAM_LR5e-06_WD0.001_BS8.tar

After the files model.aa .. model.ag are merged into one file PRETRAINED_RESNET101_ADAM_LR5e-06_WD0.001_BS8.tar, the provided script example1.py demonstrates a classification of two patches.
